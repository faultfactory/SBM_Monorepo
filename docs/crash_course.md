# Crash Course on SW Development:

Git, CI/CD, CAN, Compilation. **Scary**.<BR>  Relax. You'll be fine. This is in no particular order because there wasn't a cohesive flow.

## Git: 
Git is decentralized source control that has dominated the software industry for years now. It allows multiple parties to work on the same content simultaneously and then bring that work back together. Do not attempt to use it for Simulink files, only hand code. 
The project hinges on it. It will stretch your brain a bit but once you get it, you'll fall in love.

[This course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE) on youtube that's pretty comprehensive and addresses a lot of pitfalls for newbies. At the very least it give the terminology to allow you to google yourself out of holes later.  Even without a remote server, you can use git locally for any handcode.

You will need a github account and SBM will need to allow contributions from your account.

Tips: 
Commit early and often<br>
Branch when you're not sure, it costs you nothing<br>
Use pull requests to get buy-in from the team and document discussions.<br>
Ask me for help on slack if you need it.<br>
If you want to visualize the git graph without a GUI, use ```git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate```.

I think it's worth noting that Github is just a company hosting git remote servers. They don't own the sw package ```git```. [More detail on GitHub Here](github_magic.md)


## Mono-Repo
Just like it sounds: ```ONE REPO```. A mono-repo is a concept used to help align SW dependencies between various components in a project. Git has means of sharing code between repositories (```submodules```) but they are cumbersome and a bit much for SW newbies. <BR>
The biggest shared dependencies in any project involving software and hardware are typically communication related which is defined by the ```.dbc``` file. 
Using a mono-repo structure removes any issues caused by different versions being used by two parties. The correct version exists in the repository at that commit and nowhere else.

## CI/CD - Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
This is a big fancy word for "I automatically run tasks on someone else's computer". In the context of CI/CD typically that means building, testing, deploying, releasing etc. Github provides some basic functionality for this via Github Actions which we use for automating the creation of CAN .c and .h files, as discussed [here.](github_magic.md#autogenerated-can-interface-library) This removes managing a tool and process from your head. Just commit and push and the dependent code updates.

In the future, we can establish a pipeline to automatically build the sketch files in the cloud to make sure nothing was broken by someone's work.
